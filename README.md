# Quantum-Flux
Quantum Flux is a unique puzzle game where players manipulate quantum particles (Electrons, Protons, and Neutrons) on a grid to achieve quantum entanglement. The goal is to arrange particles by swapping adjacent ones to create balanced configurations, progressing through increasingly challenging levels.
